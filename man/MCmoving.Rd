\title{Moving Average Time Series for Radiocarbon Dates with a Response Variable (depreciated)}
\usage{
MCmoving(dl, N = 100, calcurve = "intcal", k = 13, yjitter = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dl}{A data frame or matrix containing three or four columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{BP}: Radiocarbon years before present.
\item \code{error}: Standard deviation of the radiocarbon date.
\item \code{calcurve} (optional): Calibration curve to use (default is \code{'intcal'}).
\item \verb{response variable}: The response variable of interest.
}}

\item{N}{Number of Monte Carlo resampling iterations. Default is 100.}

\item{calcurve}{Calibration curve to use for radiocarbon calibration. Default is \code{'intcal'}.}

\item{k}{Integer width of the running median window. Default is 13.}

\item{yjitter}{Amount of random jitter to add to the response variable during resampling. Default is 0.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to the plot function.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{MCd}, containing the time series of the moving average.
The first column represents calibrated calendar years, and subsequent columns
contain the simulated moving average values from the Monte Carlo resampling.
}
\description{
This depreciated function computes a moving average time series for radiocarbon (14C) dates
associated with a response variable. Its functionality has been replaced by the more flexible \code{MCrunmed}.
}
\details{
This function uses a Monte Carlo approach to simulate calibrated radiocarbon dates
and compute a moving average of the response variable. The \code{k} parameter controls the
width of the running median window applied to the (optionally jittered) response variable.
}
\examples{
# Example data
dates <- matrix(c(5000, 30, "intcal", rnorm(50)), ncol = 4)
colnames(dates) <- c("BP", "error", "calcurve", "response")

# Compute moving average
moving_avg <- MCmoving(dates, N = 50, k = 11, yjitter = 0.1)

# Plot the results
plot(moving_avg, type = "l", col = "blue", lwd = 2,
     xlab = "Cal. BC/AD", ylab = "Response Variable")
